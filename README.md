# Linux Installation Centers (Linux ICs)
Linux ICs is a platform that connects new Linux users with local experts for offline installation and distro selection support, addressing the complexity and inaccessibility of adopting Linux. By offering location-based matching, beginner-friendly guidance, and flexible free or paid services, Linux ICs empowers users to transition to Linux seamlessly while providing experts a platform to share expertise and earn income. With a growing interest in open-source software and a fragmented support landscape, Linux ICs fills a critical gap, targeting a global market of tech enthusiasts, students, and professionals.

The Linux ICs idea started from 2009/2010. Just check my blog at that time https://linux-ic.blogspot.com/
