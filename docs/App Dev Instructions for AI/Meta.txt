Linux Installation Centers (Linux ICs) Web/Mobile App Development Instructions
Overview
Develop a web and mobile app for Linux ICs, a platform that connects Linux experts with new users, providing offline installation services and support. The app should facilitate expert registration, user requests, matching, and payment processing.
Functional Requirements
User Registration and Profile Management
Users can create profiles, specifying their location and Linux needs.
Users can edit their profiles and request history.
Expert Registration and Profile Management
Experts can create profiles, showcasing their skills, experience, and location.
Experts can edit their profiles and service offerings.
Request System
Users can submit requests for Linux installation services, specifying their location and preferred distro.
Experts can view and bid on requests.
Matching System
The app should match users with nearby experts based on their requests and expert profiles.
Payment Processing
The app should facilitate payment processing for expert services, including commission-based payments.
Rating and Review System
Users can rate and review experts after service completion.
Experts can rate and review users.
Demo and Installation Services
Experts can offer demo services to users before installation.
Experts can install Linux on users' devices.
Non-Functional Requirements
Security
Implement robust security measures to protect user data and payment information.
Scalability
Design the app to scale with increasing user and expert registrations.
User Experience
Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both web and mobile apps.
Technical Requirements
Backend
Use a robust backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django) to handle API requests and business logic.
Implement a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store user and expert profiles, requests, and payment information.
Frontend
Develop a responsive web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Develop mobile apps for Android and iOS using native or cross-platform frameworks (e.g., React Native, Flutter).
API Integration
Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure payment processing.
Use geolocation APIs (e.g., Google Maps) for location-based matching.
