2. **Official Documentation**:
   - Most major distros (e.g., Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, Debian) provide detailed installation guides on their official websites. For example, Ubuntu’s website (ubuntu.com) offers tutorials for creating bootable USBs and installing offline, including dual-boot setups with Windows.[](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)[](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
   - Debian and openSUSE also have comprehensive documentation for offline installation, including steps for downloading ISOs and managing dependencies without internet access.[](https://itsfoss.com/free-linux-distributions/)[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linux/install)

3. **Offline Installation Tools**:
   - **Bootable USB Creation Tools**: Tools like balenaEtcher, Rufus, or UNetbootin allow users to create bootable USB drives for offline installation. These are often recommended in distro guides and can be used on a separate computer with internet access to prepare media for an offline system.[](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)
   - **Package Download for Offline Use**: For Ubuntu, users can download packages on one computer and transfer them via USB for offline installation. Guides for this process are available on forums like Linux.org.[](https://www.linux.org/threads/offline-software-installation.22733/)
   - **Live USB Distros**: Some distros, like Puppy Linux or Linux Mint, can run directly from a USB without installation, allowing users to test compatibility before committing to a full offline install.[](https://linuxmint.com/)[](https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-save-your-old-computer-try-one-of-these-8-linux-distros-for-free/)

4. **Local Linux User Groups (LUGs)**:
   - Linux User Groups exist globally and often host in-person or virtual events to help new users install Linux. These groups can be found via sites like Linux.org or through distro-specific communities. They may assist with offline installations during meetups but are not centralized online platforms.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linux/install)[](https://distrowatch.com/)

5. **Paid Support Options**:
   - **Enterprise Distros**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Ubuntu Pro offer paid, enterprise-grade support, including assistance with installation. However, these are aimed at businesses, not individual new users, and focus on online or subscription-based support.[](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linux/install)[](https://www.howtogeek.com/paid-linux-distros/)

I know there are a lot of desktop Linux experts all around the world which might be interested in helping new users freely or as a paid service. My plan is to register all of these experts city/location wise.

And there are a lot of new users interested in using Linux but Linux is not preinstalled mostly. And there a a lot of Linux distros, choosing one is difficult for new users. 

So these new users will put their request to install desktop Linux on their laptop/PC. Experts nearby new user location will sees this new request & offer Linux installation service free/paid to new user. If offers by the experts are accepted by the new user then expert will share a time slot to the new users. And new users will bring/send their laptop/PC to expert location because they live nearby. And expert will get usage info from the new user & suggest few of distro. 

Maybe provide demo of distro to new users. And after new user is satisfied by the one distro, the expert will install that distro to new users laptop/PC. And finally new user will take his laptop/PC from expert to his home/office :)

Final verdict: new users got Linux easily & experts might earn something.
